We have never wanted to be the poster children for any crusade or any political agenda.  However, with recent events and policy changes in the military, state, and federal governments.  We have found ourselves in the middle of a cultural change within our community and society.  I would like to share our story and our life as the "New Military Family".  So, I'll start from the beginning. . .

Russ and I met on December 10th, 1993 in Frankfurt, Germany at the Blue Angel Night Club.  We both have different interpretations on how we met that night, but Russ swears his version is the truth.  When we met I was still in the United States Air Force at the time and was struggling with making the decision to reenlist or separate.  The reason, I was struggling with my decision of reenlistment, was due to close friends and people I knew under investigation and being dishonorably discharged for being gay or lesbian.  Back then it was called a "Witch Hunt" and I was fearful of losing everything I had worked so hard for only to receive a Dishonorable Discharge from the military.  So I chose the separate with a Honorable Discharge and my VA benefits.

The night, that Russ and I met almost didn't happen.  I wasn't going to go out that night, but my friends talked me into it.  I'm so glad they did, because if I had stayed in my room that night like I had planned to.  I wouldn't have met Russ, my partner of 21 years and now happily married. 

So, now let me tell you more about Russ and I..For 18 years our relationship was a secret, and I stayed in the shadows.  We knew we weren't fooling everyone, but our story of me being a adopted brother (which our families were in on) gave our commands "probable deniability" on our relationship.  Over those 18 years, Russ was deployed five times, and we also had a Permanent Change of Duty Station (PCS) five times.  Our assignments were Fort Bliss, TX, Fort Sill, OK, Fort Lewis, WA once while in Germany from Hanau to Kaiserslautern, back to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA, a year separation during my assignment  to Fort Sam Houston, TX and now Fort Drum, NY.  And we did it all on the single soldier pay.

During these years, I spent a lot of time alone.  I had very few friends who I thought I could trust, I didn't attend Army functions and I did not go to the Army Balls or Military Police Balls.  I wasn't there when Russ received promotions, and the spouse received thanks for her/his service and sacrifices.  When Russ would deploy, we said our goodbyes at home because I feared if I embraced him at the deployment ceremony or the welcome home ceremony it would spark an investigation on him.  I would leave those ceremonies feeling so cheated, and would cry in the car on my drive home.  I was not a member of the Family Readiness Groups (FRG's) or Spouses Clubs, which meant no spousal support of any kind.   And I also had no spousal preference (which helps spouses with employment opportunities at their new location) so when we PCS'd to each new duty assignment, I would start all over again.

But all of this changed, as of Sept. 20, 2011 President Obama ended the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.  Service members would no longer be forced to hide who they were in order to serve our country.  "We thought we would never see this happen," then In June 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Windsor that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) discriminates against same-sex couples and that the federal government must treat all married couples equally. This meant that the Department of Defense (DOD) must treat same-sex married couples the same as opposite-sex married couples when providing military retirement benefits.  Then the Pentagon announced on August 14, 2013, that benefits for same-sex spouses would be available to those who could show a valid marriage license.  In addition to military retirement and survivor benefits.  I would now receive TRICARE medical benefits, military family leave, a spouse identification card, Command-sponsored visa, and the ability to receive joint duty assignments.  Also, on-post housing, housing allowances, access to legal assistance, access to all military facilities including recreation centers, bases, exchanges, and commissaries.  And for the first time in 20 years, we would be able to file our income taxes jointly as a married couple.

So, with all the policy changes now in effect Russ and I married on September 21, 2013 with family and friends in attendance and it was the happiest day of our lives.
